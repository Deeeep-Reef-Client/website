<h1>It is dark, the Sun is setting over the reef for the last time.</h1>
<p>
    All good times come to an end.
    <br />
    Fed, the developer of Deeeep.io, apparently hates players having a better experience
    through harmless and completely well-intentioned third party modifications, even if they don't give an unfair
    advantage. Although this does remove hackers, not all clients are bad, it's the perfect example of collateral
    damage. But oh well, what's done is done, and what's gone is gone.
    <br />
    The game as added an anti-"cheat" which detects clients like the DRC and automatically bans and kicks users found
    using a client. As such, it is no longer safe to continue using the Client. While some features may still work, it's
    advised you stop using the client immediately to avoid a ban.
    <br />
    The future looks bleak for the Project, which is most likely dead and will never be resurrected. The Client has been
    deprecated and will no longer be maintained.
    <br />
    It has been a fun two years working on the client, thank you for all your support, goodbye ^^
